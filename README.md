### **Cybersecurity**
- **Ethical Hacking**: Exploit development frameworks, advanced penetration testing methodologies, privilege escalation, social engineering techniques, and red teaming tactics.
- **Network Security**: Network segmentation strategies, firewall and IDS/IPS systems (Snort, Suricata), VPN technologies (IPSec, SSL/TLS), and network traffic analysis.
- **Application Security**: OWASP Top Ten mitigations, Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) like ModSecurity, SAST/DAST tools.
- **Forensics**: Digital evidence collection (disk, memory, network), forensic analysis tools (EnCase, FTK), incident response frameworks, and malware analysis.
- **Cryptography**: Symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms (AES, RSA, ECC), cryptographic protocols (TLS/SSL), blockchain security, PKI, and hashing algorithms (SHA-256, bcrypt).

### **Machine Learning**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Supervised learning (Gradient Boosting Machines, Support Vector Machines), unsupervised learning (t-SNE, UMAP), reinforcement learning (Deep Q-Learning, Policy Gradient methods).
- **Neural Networks**: Advanced architectures (ResNets, EfficientNets), Transfer Learning, Zero-shot learning, Meta-learning.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for end-to-end ML pipelines, TensorFlow Lite for mobile and edge devices, TensorFlow Hub for reusable components, TensorFlow.js for in-browser ML.
- **Model Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning tools (Optuna, Hyperopt), model pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, performance profiling.
- **Data Engineering**: Data wrangling (Pandas, Dask), feature engineering tools, ETL frameworks (Apache Airflow, Luigi), big data processing (Apache Spark, Hadoop), data versioning (DVC).
